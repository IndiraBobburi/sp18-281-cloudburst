# XP Core Value - Simplicity

### Week #1
* While discussing the project idea, we tried to demonstrate each level of an idea by drawing diagrams. Diagrams help us visualize things which simplifies the development.
* For the efficient development of the project, each team members were assigned one or two technologies to research on. After this investigation focusing on pros and cons of technologies, we can decide the most suitable technology for the selected project idea which can ease the development.
