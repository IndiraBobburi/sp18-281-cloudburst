# Heruku

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages that is used as a web application deployment model. Heroku, one of the first cloud platforms, has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.

Applications that are run on Heroku typically have a unique domain (typically "applicationname.herokuapp.com") used to route HTTP requests to the correct dyno. Each of the application containers, or dynos, are spread across a "dyno grid" which consists of several servers. Heroku's Git server handles application repository pushes from permitted users.

All Heroku services are hosted on Amazon's EC2 cloud-computing platform.
